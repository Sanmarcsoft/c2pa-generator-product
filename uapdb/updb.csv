SAN GABRIEL,US,1,1,1900,12:00:00,AM,20:00  (Entered as : 1975 aprx 8 or 9 pm.),"Cigar or oblong shaped object, just sat there in orange and reddish brown clouds. Never did anything and we went to bed.

I was curious about some of the 1970's sightings. I was party to one of them but for whatever reason our family of five (all witness) never reported or talked about it until recently when more people and shows began investigating some of the strange phenomena. I was a cigar like shape surrounded by orange, brown and reddish clouds or ""smoke"". It was large and long and just sat there doing absolutely nothing. In fact after a few snapshots (which did not develop, we had a regular fast shutter speed camera), we got a bit bored and went inside I believe. It went away and we never saw it again. It was in San Gabriel, California and seemed so close we could touch it if we had climbed a large tree. This is the only way I could describe it from a child's memory, but I still remember it clearly, but not exactly afterwards. We headed for bed after waiting for a long time for it to do something. I am very curious to know if anyone has ever seen this type of UFO in the past or recently.

FRUITLAND PARK,US,1,1,1900,12:00:00,AM,20:00  (Entered as : Fall 94? between 20:00 &amp; 21:30),"Stepped out in the backyard and was enjoying the evening noticed lower than the clouds normally are, 5-7 slightly off white (not glaring) lights flying in a not quite striaght line, but more like an angle. Sort of like the left arm of a ""V"" formation. i looked to see if was a dark shadow of a plane wing or something, but no shape.There was no noise associated with them. They moved rather slowly, then suddenly disappeared.

I tried to get the kids to come out to witness the lights move slowly ove the back yard, but couldn't get them outside in time. I tried to get a date and time from the Lake County Sherriff records department, because I reported the above, but they said they hadn't gotten computers in yet and many times didn't keep the hand written reports made. That night when the deputy came I asked if anybody else had made a simular report? He said he wasn't aware of any. This has bothered me for years. Several years ago in Idaho my husband, two older children and I had seen very bright, small star like things (two of them) that seemed to be out of this atmosphere darting to and fro, one minute in one spot then all of a sudden in an other spot so fast your human eye lost track of them for a moment. We saw another just like the two only it was only one in California. I don't remember dates or time of year on either The Idaho event or California event.

This is a story my father and his brother have told me about the time they belive they saw two alien beings. 

My fater and his brother were walking through the woods along the rail road tracks. They saw two short beings wearing long black over coats and large brimmed hats.

The two beings faced them and My father and his brother saw that they had no face. It was completly blank and white.

My father and his brother took off running away from the two beings. 

Im not sure weather this story is true. My father assures me it is and I can only take his word for it.

neighbor amd his sister came to get me my sister and maid to see the ufo in the street no higher up than a telephone pole. It made only a humming noise and was competely motionless. I vaguely remember it being round or eliptical. The only other strong impression I have is of the electrical/ fire energy shooting constantly from front to back or visa versa.We watched it move away and could see it from the treehouse in the general area of the jr highschool moving in an orbital pattern round and round. Finally my sister and I got bored and went back inside. I was 12 or 13 at the time which would make my sister 8 or 9. She doesnt really remember and the maid now says she knows it was one of those helicopters selling KFC. I would like to find the neighbor kids..... I bet they remember! I have never forgotten it and I am obviously a true believer.

PORTLAND,US,1,1,1900,12:00:00,AM,20:00  (Entered as : 3/?/94 20:00),"Watched a bright blue ball, in the evening, for about three blocks in a residential area in Northeast Portland. It was about 50 feet overhead.

Went for an evening walk in a residential neighborhood in NE Portland. While walking I noticed a blue cast on a lawn. I looked over at the house thinking that it must be Christmas lights not yet taken down, but there were none. Thought nothing more about it. About five minutes later I again noticed the blue cast on a lawn. This time I looked up. Directly overhead was a bright blue ball. Apparently it had been following me. I stopped and the ball contined moving. I estimated it at about 100 foot above the ground, and about 2-3 feet in diameter. I based this estimate on a tree that it passed over. It moved very slowly for about a block, then banked left but continued moving. When it banked left a bright orange light came on in the center of the ball. I watched it move for about 2 more blocks, then it simply disappeared. I looked for searchlights or any lights in the sky but there were none. I then became quite frightened and returned home. I retraced my steps the next day. No Christmas tree lights. I revised my estimate of height to about 50 feet above the ground because the tree that I used for estimating was much shorter than it appeared in the dark. I mentioned the blue ball to my brother who suggested that it might be ball lightning. I checked the weather and there was some lightning in the Portland area that evening. Have never seen anything like it before or since. The blue ball was simply beautiful Background.

Some years ago, standing in my backyard, I looked up an saw a triangular shaped object with a round cigar shaped bottom. The craft was a beautiful brillant blue. From the nose what appeared as an electrical charge started and snaked across the body of the craft. As it did the color from the nose bac changed to a beautiful green. When the charge stopped at the tail the entire object was green. Sparks or shrouds of light came from the back (approx. 30 ft long) The object lurched forward and disappeared in a few milliseconds. Anything like this reported before.

One object triangular in shape.  Size approximately 100 feet long. Bottom of craft appeared rounded.  Color at time of sighting: Light that was blue. Noticable change: An electrical color snaked or wormed through the body starting from what appeared to be the nose. As the light snaked through the color behind it changed to a beautiful green. At termination of electrical charge the entire color was green. Sparks or energy rods shot from the back of the object as it lurched slightly forward and then disappeared in a few miliseconds. I do not wish to have my name released and request confidentiality. I am curious is anything like this has ever been reported. If you want to contact me by e-mail, please do.

GAINESVILLE,US,1,1,1900,12:00:00,AM,20:00  (Entered as : 05/00/67 20:00),"We saw very close to us just above the trees a Dark-solid-Triangle it Red Globe glowing lights on each corner (triangle was 25-30ft equilateral in shape)

I am now 47, but at the time of the sighting I was 14 years of age and me and the neighborhood gang of four other kids (three of which were two brothers and one sister)were outside before we had to go in for the night looking for a Satellite that had been launched from Cape Canaveral that morning. It must have been around 8:00pm and it was just after dark and the weather was warm, clear sky, no clouds. Stars visible. I was the oldest and the ages of the other kids ranged down to about 8-9. We were in our own neighborhood and standing at the end of the street. Exact intersection address is N.W 42nd Ave. and N.W.9th Street The kids started yelling for me to look at some lights approaching us from the North. The first thing I saw was a soft red light approaching us thru the trees. And as it approached closer I could see two more red lights coming with it. My first thought was...what is that? As it came into the clear spot from behind the trees, the shape could be seen....a dark sharply outlined Equilateral Triangle with Three round-globe softly glowing blood-red lights, one on each corner where it would have come to a point if the lights were absent.It was Approximately 25-30 feet tip to tip each side although it could have been slightly larger.It was moving about 3-5mph...this I know because after we got a good look at it, we ran ahead of it in the same direction. The purpose of was to get my friends parents outside so they could see it too.they were only about seven houses down on the same street we were on (9th). And we were able to run ahead of this thing which was not too much higher that the trees... maybe 60ft up but less than 100ft. Well my friends parents Did witness this... But I will say this...I have never really understood their reaction to what we saw. The Father, who had been in the army and in Germany and tinkered with free-flight gas engine airplanes, saw this, and went back in the house and didnt say anything....I think he was spooked.... but when I asked him several times during the time after..even years after..he said He didnt know what it was, but would not discuss it... The Mother was spooked and didnt understand what she saw..now this is from my viewpoint of course... but I know how they acted at the time and remember it.But as far as my friends go, the two brothers and sister, They have all talked about it in the years since....we all know we saw something very strange. This machine, and it was a craft...was SILENT and if there was a sound, we didnt hear it.I could answer questions about this easier in person... because this typing is draining.. I have never been able to forget this experience. I was not afraid but really want to know the answer... I want to know if there was any other reports of this back in 1967 in Florida or elsewhere... and there is more to this story....something related happened 11 years later and about 60 miles away in Ocala National Forest.But this is too cumbersome here for me to say it all... I met Stanton Friedman in person here in Florida a few years back at White Springs and shared this with him, and Gave him a sketch of this that I made, but he had no information to share...he just thanked me for what I gave him...

OSCODA,US,1,1,1900,12:00:00,AM,(Entered as : 09?/?/1975),"Funny flashing lights that hovered then just dashed up into the sky, near Oscoda in the late summer of 1975.

I was 7 at the time and this is the best I can recall--sorry for the poor answers. I was camping with my indian guide group at a YMCA camp near Oscoda Michigan. I think the camp was called camp oeasa (I am not sure how it is spelled). There were about 15 kids and about half as many adults. most of the adults had gone to sleep, but there were at least one or two on night watch, to keep us kids out of trouble. We were all in sleeping bags around a camp fire, lying on our backs when I remember seeing a string for flashing lights hovering in the sky, then just shoot up into the stars after about a minute of so. I do not remember if I saw it and started talking about it, or if someone else noticed it and I looked up. I remember joking about it with the ohter kids. It was very strange! It looked just like a funny string of very funny looking Christmas tree lights flashing. It was so long ago that I can not even guess how far away, how big, etc... What ever it was, it did not make any sound that I can recall. There is a near by Air base and I remember wondering if it was something from there, but I do not know of anything that could have come from Oscoda that might look and behave like that. But then again who knows? It is worth reporting anyhow.

a friend and i were going to a friends house out in the gillburg community and just happened to be talking about ufo's. my friend stopped at the top of the long driveway which went in between 2 tobacco fields to relieve himself. all of a sudden he starts yelling for me to look outside the car at the sky. what we saw was what looked like a bright star to the left of the driveway. it sat there bobbing around for a few seconds, then stopped.then it shot off atan incalculable speedto thenorth towards henderson. we then proceeded down the driveway to the house dumbfounded and amazed by what we had just seen. when we got out of the car we looked up at the opposite side of the driveway and saw 3 more objects. these objects were nowhere near where we saw the 1st one.they also stayed in one area. they were making eratic maneuvers. they would go up and down,diagonally, spiral. no human could have withstood tne g-force exerted by the craft.i went in to the house and got the girl who lived there along w/ her 7 yr old son and they witnessed the same thing. i was so amazed that i went next door to a guys house i didn't even know and showed it to him. he was just as amazed as we were.we watched them for awhile and went inside. they were still there 30 min. later when we came out. this isn't the only encounter i have had w/ these objects but it is the only time i have seen more than 1 at the time. i don't know what is going on around here. i'm not the only one seeing this. other people are seeing it too. its just that people around here don't report stuff like that. that isn't the only encounter i've had hereeither. i've encountered other types of objects that i will write in about later.sometimes , me and a friend will go out on clear nights and look for them. we almost never come home dissapointed. if someone else in this area or anywhere has seen anything similar, e- mail me and tell me about it at ((e-address deleted)). i would love to hear your story.

BRISTOL,US,1,1,1900,12:00:00,AM,   (Entered as : unknown),"Hi, I am an avid sky watcher and usually I notice little balls or white and sometimes blue lights traveling slowly overhead. Even when these objects are still overhead they fade out as if they were moving further away but they will still be directly overhead as I mentioned.

The most recent sighting of one of these balls of lights my sister and I were standing out side of her house and I said, ""Hey, there goes one of them things."" My sister looked up and noticed it coming our direction.

As soon as it got overhead of us it stopped but then after about a three or four second pause the ball of light started moving very erratically from side to side.

My sister thought it might be a satellite, but I told her I don't think they move that fast.

I was wondering if you have heard anything like this before? Thank you

My brother mom and I were looking through the bay windows overlooking the Sunnyside part of the valley when approaching from the left we witnessed two triangle objects the size of 747's floating effortlessly across the valley. My brother and I were the first to see them and excitedly called our mom over to look. We stood gazing out for a period of roughly 8 minutes until they floated out of sight. I remember well the objects were decked out in a gray metallic gleam that I have never seen before on an aircraft. I was 13 at the time and have always thought back to it. I never mentioned it and never thought of doing so until all the recent sightings in the yakima valley.

These objects we have been seeing since September 2000, are Disk shaped. We have seen very cleary windows in-circling the whole disk. These objects emit Bright, Blue, Green, Red and Yellow lights. The movement of these objects are: Zig Zagging, Side to Side and Up and Down movements. Sometimes we have seen them flying. We are a family of 3. Age groups ranging from 32-81 years old. Our neighbors have also witnessed these objects. We have a panoramic view of the Ocean. We have spent HOURS and HOURS, observing and trying to figure out what it is we are seeing. We had a local newsreporter come to our house and she wrote a big article on our sightings. I called Peter Davenport in Seattle and also, the local Coast Guards, local Airport here in Newport and McMinnville, Oregon. Also, the local National Guard and have gotten a brush off from all of them. Have talked to a scientist at The Mcdonald Observatory in Texas and he assured! us that what we were seeing was not! stars, satellites or plantets. His exact words were, ""It is a phenomena"". Please, let us know what it is we are seeing in the skys of Newport, Oregon. We have taken many pictures but unfortunately they do not come out. Please, contact us. Thank you.

the noiseless floating motion and the figures moving about this craft with the red background.

I was a 2nd shift foreman at a rubber factory. At break time (8pm) one of my men called me outside where he had been having a cigarette. He pointed above and to the left of us. Some type of vehicle was, very slowly, floating from the northwest to the southeast. There were a series, slanted downward, windows in the craft. We could see figures moving about and some were apparently looking down out of the windows. The background behind the figures was red, making the figures look like silohettes. The strange thing about the craft was the rather bobbing motion it had while moving along as it wasn't a smooth motion. We watched it for about 10 minutes altogether. Because of the darkness it was impossible to see much of a shape of the craft other than the lighted windows were in a curved arc. I have been rather hesitant in talking about this sighting. I rarely mention this to people as they look at me like I'm a little demented. I only believe what I see and this I did see.

GLENNONVILLE,US,1,1,1900,12:00:00,AM,20:00  (Entered as : 1980-82 20:00),"Looked out my bedroom window to see an orange glowing ball circling around one of our family sheds, about 3-4 feet off the ground. From a distance of about 20feet, the sphere glowed brightly, circled at random speeds around the shed--probably 5-7 times and then disappeared--it didn't fly away, it just went around the shed and never came back into view.

I was probably 10-12 yrs and had a bedroom to myself--whereas my 3 brothers shared a room in our home. One of my brothers had a family friend over--I can't think he was over 14-15 then. The friend and my brother were witnesses to this event, but i have never questioned either of them in all these years since. I saw the glowing sphere and screamed for someone to come in my room and look out the window. My brother's friend and my brother both did, and we all three looked out the window at the orange glowing ball circling our ""tin shed"" as we called it--it was made out of tin and held such items like gardening tools and the like. From the distance of my room to the shed, the glowing ball looked to be about 2-3 times the size of basketball--but I was too little to really judge at that time. It went around the shed at various speeds, sometimes quickly and sometimes not, but after a few revolutions, it just disappeared. I went out there the next day, and saw nothing unusual, not that I knew what to look for anyway. I have told this story many times over the years, but had never heard of anything like it, until reading other stories on the net and decided I would write. I am now 31 and my brother and his friend 36 respectively. I have had other strange encounters over the years--and one just this January in my new town of residence, St Louis.

ODESSA,US,1,1,1900,12:00:00,AM,(Entered as : 1975-1976 24-01:00),"I have more than one event to report, but I will do them seperately and chronilogically. The first event I remember occurred in either the summer of 1975 or 1976. My husband (at the time)and I shared a common interest in things like weather-watching, storm-chasing and skywatching in general. We had driven to a remote area Southwest of Odessa, Texas to a place on the Caprock that was an excellent skywatching spot. There are many radio, and television transmitters strung for miles along this caprock. We had driven to a spot where the line of towers was behind us by probably 5 miles at most. We were in his small convertible sports car.....an old, tiny mid-engine Porsche.........and we were sitting on the tops of our seats where they met with the frame of the car. There was no back seat to this car, and it was like a T-top. I don't remember how long we had been watching the sky, when one of us spotted what at first looked like it might be a satellite...........reminded me of a moving star. No blinking or twinkling to speak of, no changes in intensity. We first noticed it in the northwest, and it was moving slowly but steadily. across the sky towards the Southwest. We became convinced it was a satellite within about 30 seconds, and at this point, it was in the center of our field of vision (almost due West). If you think in terms of inches, it was about 12 inches above the horizon at that point we came aware of another identical light moving from the Southeast along the same horizontal plane. We both then began to scan the entire sky almost instinctively, and immediately became aware that there were numerous lights coming from several directions, including directly overhead . I remember at this point I was extremely excited and we were both shouting expletives and I was saying over and over, Whaat is going on, now.............come on, what the hell is happening and him saying Wait, wait, look over here and oh crap there's another one. They finally had us convinced that they were going to collide and I remember how intense the feeling was that we were about to witness an explosion of! some ki nd...........but instead, as they got closer to each other, they slowed a bit, all at the same rate, and all stopped instantly, where then you saw what was either six or eight spots of light in a circle, equidistant from each other. Then they began to flash independently but in an organized sequence that then gave an impression of an octagon or six-pointed star. It was like if you drew dots on a piece of paper and then connected the dots so that the shape was revealed. However, It seemed that the area within the dots was not obscured. You could see the night sky within the area formed by the dots. After about maybe 30 seconds to a minute (I have never been sure about how much time went by) they stopped flashing, one at a time, as if each had to complete a sequence, then they were gone for a couple of seconds, then all lit up at once, and began to increase in brightness, and then began to glow red, and then streaked off in all 6 or eight directions, leaving trails that reminded me of meteors on fast-forward but disappeared before traveling halfway across the sky. As we sat there with our mouths hanging open, I was crying in wonder more that fear. About 10 seconds maybe, after they disappeared, we heard what sounded like a sonic boom and a flash that lit up the whole sky for a split second, brightest at the horizon. Only in retrospect can a say that the flash reminds me of what I have seen in films of nuclear bombs.......the first flash. I can remember us jumping off the car and each lighting cigarettes and just standing there smoking and looking at the sky and not speaking, me crying. Then we put the top back on the car and headed home. I remember the drive from our location to the highway, but I don't remember anything else about getting home. My next memory was going to work the next day and telling my boss and co-workers about it, and being ridiculed about it for weeks afterward. My ex-husband and I stayed friends and had other skywatching adventures, but only eclipses and meteor showers. I cannot remember us talking about it to each other in anything but a round-about way, except for a couple of times, between the event and when I moved to Tulsa in 1980. I had very little contact with him from then until 1985, when I had been back in West Texas about a year. I attempted to ask him about the subject, and he said he didn't remember the details very well. I sensed an even greater reluctance to discuss it when we talked again about 3 years ago.

CHARLESTOWN,US,1,1,1900,12:00:00,AM,(Entered as : 1980 &amp; NOW),"BOTH TIEMS OCCUR IN SPRING SUMMER MONTHS.

IN 1980 MY FAMILY AND I WAS TRAVELING DOWN ROUTE 1 FROM CHARLESTOWN TO WESTERLY, RIGHT NEAR THE AIRPORT, HOVERING VERY LOW JUST OVER THE TREES,CLOSER TO THE WATER WERE TWO OBJECTS. AT FIRST MY FATHER SAID THEY ARE JUST PLANES. AS ME AND MY BROTHER SCREAMED, MY FATHER LOOKED UP AND REALIZED THEY WERE NOT.  OUT OF SHOCK, HE PULLED THE CAR OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THEY LINGERED, AND THE NEXT THING WE KNEW THEY WERE GONE. 

THEY WERE SILVER DISCS ALMOST,LIKE ALUMINUM FOIL COLOR, AND LONG FLAT DISC OVAL SHAPED. tHINKING BACK, THEY SEEMED VERY LARGE AS A CHILD, AND IT WAS AT SUNSET. THEY ALMOST LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE LIT UP FROM THE INSIDE, FOR WE COULD CLEARLY SEE THEM AS IT WAS GETTTING DARK. tHEY WERE PROBABLY ABOUT 200 OR 300 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, VERY CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT. THEY CAME FROM BEHIND US, WHICH WAS FROM NEWPORT DIRECTION TOWARD WESTERLY. EVER SINCE THEN WHEN I VISIT MY PARENTS, I SIT OUT ON THE DECK AT NIGHT, AND USE A TELESCOPE AND LOOK TOWARDS NEWPORT. I SWEAR I HAVE SEEN THEM, BUT DO NOT TELL PEOPLE. PRESENTLY I ALWAYS SEE 3, FLYING VERY CLOSE TOGETHER, BOBBING UP AND DOWN, REAL HIGH, AND FAR AWAY, MY GUESS VERY CLOSE TO NEWPORT OR BLOCK ISLAND, IT SEEMS THEY ARE ABOVE THE OCEAN AT LEAST 2000 FEET. I QUESTION IF THEY CAN SEE ME, BECAUSE, AS SOON AS LOOK IN THAT DIRECTION, THEY SPLIT APART, THEN MOMENTS LATER THE 3 SAUCERS ARE CLOSE TOGETHER AGAIN.  I TRULY QUESTION IF SOMETHING IS GOING ON AT THE NAVY BASE IN NEWPORT RHODE ISLAND, AND IN GROTON, CONNECTICUT.  ISN'T IT A COINCIDENCE, THAT BOTH NAVAL BASES ARE CLOSE BY AND SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD SIGHTINGS.ALSO, WHEN I LOOK AT THEM FROM A DISTANCE, THEY SEEM TO BE LIT UP,SAME SHAPE, BUT L IT LIKE LIGHT BULBS BOBBING UP AND DOWN.

It is said that long before I was born when my uncle was a mere Teenager a craft flew across the mountains at immense speeds, leaving a large crackling sound (assuming it was test flights to break the sound barrier around Idian Town Gap my Uncle thought nothing of it.). 

This wasn't a big deal, untill he saw 2 fighter planes come zooming after it minutes later, their speeds were much slower. A few days later, the newspaper had sightings of a U.F.O. 

Thus ending the theory that it was an enemy spy plane that the town has come up with. 

I was told this by my cousin about a month ago near Christmas and had just remembered it moments ago. My theory is that they (government) were using Tesla energy (large crackling sound).

All these were remarkably DIFFERENT in nature and all were observed in the company of witnesses. I first thought about reporting them to someone when I came across the Lemon Grove(CA) (sighting/landing?) description from the 70's on the Internet. Apparently, a youth was the witness to that actual incident but I had overheard a conversation about it taking place in a coffee shop between members of the Lemon Grove Sheriff's Department within a month or so and it had peaked my curiosity since the landing had apparently been sighted in the BACK YARD of the house I had occupied for a number of years and had only RECENTLY left. 

A lenghty experience with lights, one to three in number had taken place during the same period lasting for over a week. I never followed up looking into the (landing) report.

Animal Reaction Feature:
The witness, Lee, was a security guard at a food plant.Â As part
of his job, he periodically walked a circuit around the fenced property
of the plant.Â Two dogs (boxer/pit bull types) lived nearby and
always, without fail, barked and behaved aggressively when Lee walked
this circuit.Â On February 18 at about 7 pm, Lee stepped outside
and the dogs were silent.Â This was so strange that he went to
look for them.Â He found them sitting next to one another, both
looking up into the air.Â Lee followed their gaze but detected
nothing.Â He tried to get the dogsâ€™ attention.Â One ignored
him and continued to look upward, and the other turned its head to look
at him, and then returned its gaze upward. Lee left them and proceeded
to walk the plant perimeter fence and then went back inside.

When he came out to walk the perimeter at 9:20 pm, the dogs were
normally loud and aggressive and have continued to be so ever
since.Â However, during this 9:20 pm circuit, Lee sighted a
stationary line of 15-20 very bright lights in a perfectly straight
horizontal line. After 40-45 seconds, these lights faded in a
systematic manner.
[Although there is a 2 hour 20 minute time span between the
dogsâ€™ behavior and the appearance of the unknown lights, Lee felt there
was a relationship between these events and presented his sighting from
that viewpoint--jw]
Joan Woodward, Animal Reaction Specialist:
Lee, 29, reported his hearing and eyesight as good.Â A family man,
he gave the impression of taking his job seriously.Â He had one
other sighting of something he could not identify 7 years previously.
The events of February 18 took place in a city environment. Although
Lee reported a clear night with the moon visible [full moon was
February 19],Â NOAA weather data indicates mist and low overcast
to his west and some mist and 50 percent cloud cover to his east.
The horizontal row of 15-20 lights was perfectly straight and
evenly spaced.Â Their brightness was â€œalmost blinding.â€",NORTH CAROLINA,4453035,5182510,35.70791,5193936,-79.81364,,NICAP,1q5pu7e,"'-20':213,365,578 '-45':225,476 '/category':13 '10':634 '15':212,364,577 '18':24,80,316 '19':337 '2':238,403,671 '20':182,203,240 '2000':25 '21':631 '22':744 '23':752 '24':753 '25':758 '28':755 '29':278 '30':591 '4':14 '40':224,475 '50':353 '500':599 '6':633,639 '7':83,309 '9':181,202 'actual':610 'aggress':72,190 'air':117,559 'almost':376 'although':234,323 'alway':66 'anim':15,27,274,805 'anoth':111 'appear':250 'area':654 'arm':570 'around':51,434 'arrang':775 'asheboro':20 'attach':469 'attent':131 'back':170 'ball':394 'bark':69 'basketbal':568,617 'began':480 'behav':71 'behavior':247 'blind':377 'blue':420,547 'boxer/pit':60 'bright':7,215,374,410 'brightest':391 'bull':61 'call':721 'came':174 'carolina':22 'case':17,18,660 'center':417,546 'chang':688 'check':809 'circuit':50,77,205 'citi':321 'clear':327 'cloud':355,706 'color':379 'continu':136,193,542 'copi':788 'could':306,442,695 'cover':356,575 'data':340 'degre':592 'detect':123 'dim':483,496,523,537,552 'director':771 'directori':19 'disappear':485,498,525,539,554,708 'discuss':819 'dog':1,59,90,130,185,246 'draw':26,761 'east':359 'effect':16,628 'elev':588 'em':625 'email':765 'end':384,400,495,507,536,676 'environ':322 'eras':811 'estim':562 'even':371 'event':263,313 'ever':197 'eyesight':283 'fade':229 'fail':68 'famili':287 'far':506 'featur':29 'februari':23,79,315,336,630,743,751,757 'feet':600 'felt':256,466,604 'fenc':53,166 'file':716 'fill':793 'fire':396 'first':520 'follow':119,382,488 'food':39 'form':792,800 'found':105 'fufor':728 'full':333 'fund':723 'gave':290 'gaze':121,154 'general':653 'georg':767 'get':128 'glow':433 'good':285 'guard':36 'hair':778 'head':145 'hear':281 'heard':621 'held':566 'horizont':4,221,361 'hour':239,741 'hover':9 'howev':199 'identifi':308 'ignor':133 'impress':292 'indic':341,803 'individu':607 'insid':171,397 'interv':817 'joan':272,821 'job':45,296 'jw':271,439 'kind':785 'leav':555 'lee':32,74,85,118,156,206,255,277,324,427,465,561,641,694,782 'left':157 'length':572 'level':585 'light':8,216,228,254,366,385,401,407,414,418,430,452,479,492,503,516,522,532,548,579,608 'like':392,667 'line':210,222 'live':63 'long':664 'look':101,113,138,147 'loud':188 'low':344 'lund':768,784 'man':288 'manner':233 'meet':780,797 'minut':241 'mist':342,351,438 'moon':331,334 'motion':685 'move':702 'mr':766,783 'mufon':769,791,799 'nc':772 'nearbi':64 'neon':423 'next':108,517 'night':328 'noaa':338,436 'normal':187 'north':21 'note':717 'noth':124,441,556 'object':649,666 'obvious':812 'one':110,132,300,494 'orang':405,514,530 'orange-r':404,513,529 'orient':690 'outsid':87 'overcast':345 'part':42 'pencil':669 'percent':354 'perfect':219,368,454 'perimet':165,179 'period':47,560 'phone':737 'physiolog':627 'place':318 'plant':40,57,164 'pm':84,183,204,635,640 'point':673,693 'posit':464 'present':265 'previous':311 'proceed':160 'process':541 'properti':54 'qualiti':424 'react':2 'reaction':28,275,806 'receiv':760 'red':387,399,406,413,491,502,515,521,531 'relat':463 'relationship':260 'remain':549 'report':279,325,428,437,711 'request':730 'research':726 'return':152 'robert':777 'row':5,362,450 'said':581 'saw':662 'second':226,477,644 'secur':35 'see':696 'seen':444 'sent':786 'sequenc':489 'serious':297 'shape':699 'side':682,684 'side-to-sid':681 'sight':207,267,302 'silent':92 'sinc':198 'singl':472 'sit':107 'size':611 'sky':657 'skygroup':12 'slight':680 'smoke':704 'someth':304 'sound':619 'sourc':709 'space':372 'span':243 'specialist':276 'spoke':732,746 'state':770 'stationari':209 'step':86 'still':455 'straight':220,369 'strang':96 'structur':473 'sunset':636 'systemat':232,482 'take':294 'taper':672 'thin':665 'thought':595 'time':242,816 'took':317 'treetop':584 'tri':126 'triangular':698 'tthe':378 'turn':143 'two':58 'type':62 'ufo':725 'unknown':253,648 'upward':139,155 'variat':460 'view':645 'viewpoint':270 'visibl':332 'walk':48,75,162,177 'weather':339 'went':99,169 'west':348 'wit':31,720 'within':598 'without':67 'woodward':273,822 'would':574 'written':713 'year':310",,772

I have a 1680 book of the History of Dresden, Germany. There is a description of three objects that appeared in the sky in 1620 with an apparent exchange of light rays and smoke and noise between the larger round object and the two smaller ones round ones on either side. The population who witnessed this were quite frightened. The objects remained for many hours and then disappeared.

A huge triangle was discovered hovering low and silently in
the dark over a remote hunting camp. The presence of the mules in the
camp was indicated when the men inside the camper thought a bear might
be after the mules when they heard their companion yelling
outdoors.Â No more was said about the mules, implying that they
were not vocalizing, trying to escape, or otherwise making themselves
noticeable.

The case was reported to NUFORC.Â Â Peter

Subject: Nipomo CA,
March 30, 2001

Cat: 4
To: NICAP

Animal Reaction Feature:

Dogs through out the neighborhood barked and howled as an
odd red glow was observed in the clear night sky.

The sighting:

A witness who has reported strange sightings previously took
her dog out for a walk at 10:30 PM when she noticed a strange, mostly stationary
red 1glow1 that spanned1 1quite a
distance on the horizon.11 1Dog vocalizations were noted as indicated
above. She decided against walking her dog.1
Her husband walked the dog instead and noted the weirdness of the sky
event and the strangeness of the barking dogs.

Peter Davenport (NUFORC) states that a major coronal mass
ejection from the sun resulted in an unusual aurora (www.SpaceWeather.com ).1 He received reports from Utah, Oregon,
California, Texas, and New Mexico.1 The
sighting from New Mexico reported white searchlights associated with the red
mass.

[No other dog vocalizations were reported.1 The Nipomo barking/howling dogs were
probably reacting to some unnoticed stimulus that occurred while the red aurora
was observed by witnesses.1jw]

Jewel Valley, California
January 31, 2002

Animal Reaction Feature:
At 5:30 am PST, a border patrol officer was sitting in his car with his male
German Shepherd protection dog in the back seat.Â The back windows were
1down a little bit so he could get air.1Â The witness head a rapidly
oscillating humming sound that became louder, and he was thinking that something
was wrong with his truck.Â His dog 1got startled, and he jumped up and
was looking out the window.1Â When the witness looked to see what the
dog was looking at, he saw a large disc that flew directly over him going
west to east. This disc was followed by more discs, and embedded among the
discs was a large boomerang- shaped object.Â Aside from the oscillating
hum, the witness also referred to a vibration that could be barely felt.
He estimated the objects were 300 feet (or yards) overhead, and commented
that if they had license plates, he could have read them.Â He compared
their speed to that of a Cessna.
Joan Woodward, Animal Reaction Specialist:
An INS Agent on the California/Mexican border near Boulevard, CA, alerted
by a sound and by his dog, saw a domed disc fly over his vehicle, followed
by many more similar discs (estimated 20 to 30 of them) with a boomerang-shaped
object embedded among them, which he compared to a military bomber. (Peter
Davenport, Director, National UFO Reporting Center, who took the report, assumed
he is referring to the B-2 Bomber).Â The witness got on the radio, asking
if anyone had seen aircraft, but he received no reply.Â At that point
he 1killed all my lights and I hit my overheads.1Â When he did that,
the objects started to ascend, became star-like, and were lost in the night
sky.Â Davenport reported that the witness1s impression was that the discs
were responding to the motion of the boomerang.Â Although their speed
was compared to that of a Cessna, when they ascended, the witness reported
they became smaller quickly.
The description of the discs was that they 11had a domed top and had circular
lights around the base of the dome11Â Davenport1s NUFORC report describes
this as fluctuating illumination around a flange. The lights were described
as different shades of white, from bright yellow to beige, and the discs themselves
were a gray or bluish-gray color.Â The witness went on to say these discs
did not appear to be high tech machinery to his eye. He compared them to hover
craft made 20 years ago.Â He thought their diameter to be equal to 2-3
bus lengths.
It was calm and quiet, and other than the oscillating sound and slight
vibration already described, the witness commented that there was no disruption,
rumbling, shaking, or air movement that one would expect for that many jets
flying that low.Â The duration of the sighting was about 1 minute.
No EM effects (other than the fact that the witness received no response
to his radio call) or physiological effects were reported.

Brandywine, Maryland
July 26, 2002

Animal Reaction Feature:
At 1:30 AM and again at 1:40 AM, Gary Dillman working a late-night security
shift saw a glowing orange object being pursued by a military fighter.
The pursuit took place between broken clouds at about 4,000 feet and a light
overcast at about 6,000 feet and the unknown object and fighter were estimated
to be 1 to 2 miles away.Â Although the engine of the fighter could
be heard, Gary could detect no sound from the orange object.Â Two dogs
were in Gary1s vicinity during these pursuits.Â One was a part-pit-bull
female, shy and sweet to people but who will bark at people when they are
at a distance and who will chase cars.Â The second was a chained part-chow
male who has a reputation of biting (actually grabbing trouser legs) and
who is an excellent alarm dog frequently hearing and alerting to activity
near the main gate 1 of a mile away.Â Both dogs have good eyesight,
great hearing, and are accustomed to aircraft from Andrews AFB flying overhead.
In this case, neither reacted in any way to the orange object/fighter pursuit.

Joan Woodward, Animal behavior specialist:
The orange object was described as hard-edged, more like glowing metal than
like a light source, and its shape varied from round to ellipse as it flew
a curved path while being followed by a military fighter.Â Duration
of the sighting was 10-15 seconds both at 1:30 and 1:40, and the travel
path was similar both times.Â Â The witness is a retired policeman
and this was his first report of an unidentified object.

A second military jet pursuit of an unknown occurred during this same time
period in Waldorf, Maryland, about 8-9 miles from Brandywine.Â That
witness, Renny Rogers, had two pet collies, but they were indoors and not
observed during his sighting.

No EM effects or physiological effects were reported.

Animal Reaction Feature:

A dog was indicated to have reacted fearfully during this
sighting of distant flickering nocturnal lights.1 [MUFON investigator stated that in his opinion, the dog was
1probably reacting to the general excitement of the family/witnesses or the
multiple kids out and about the area, 11jw]*1

The Sighting (IFO):1

A homemaker (58) reported seeing a fast moving, flickering
light that changed speed at 11:07 PM in a clear sky. Duration of the event was
estimated to be an hour.

Investigators joined the witness to watch the night sky. The
witness was found to have glaucoma and to have severe vision problems. She
reacted very strongly to an Iridium flare and also to satellites and other
mundane distant lights.

The sighting was deemed a 1borderline1 IFO by the
investigator.

No sound was reported.1
Physiological effects of stiffness and effects on eyesight were
reported.11 An EM effect of static on a
cell phone was reported.

was heardDate: Thu, 22 Sep 2005 06:43:22

Animal Reaction Feature:
Dogs in the Sudden Valley area began howling and at about the same
time, an odd cyclic humming sound was heard.Â Looking around,
witnesses saw a large object with a repeating, spectacular light
display.Â The object was nearly overhead when first seen, and at
this point, the witnessesdog appeared bothered and jumped inside their
vehicle whose door was open [not stated if this dog vocalized or
howledjw]

The Sighting:
Sudden Valley [48.723Â°N, 122.345Â°W], mentioned in the
sighting, is located next to Lake Whatcom and is 9.5 miles SE of
Bellingham.

The two witnesses were husband and wife.Â At 8:45 PM PST,
they were at home in a generally wooded environment.Â The wife was
standing outside watching her husband chop wood when the sighting
occurred.Â Both submitted reports to NUFORC, and Peter Davenport
spoke to the husband, finding him credible and cogent.Â Duration
of the sighting was estimated as 5-10 minutes (wife) and 2-3 minutes
(husband).

The night was reported as clear, star-filled, and cold.Â [End
of twilight was 4:41 PM PST; a 23% visible waxing moon crescent set at
8:53 PM (U.S. Naval Observatory).Â Planets were not a factor, with
only Saturn visible low in the east (Heavens-above.com).Â Auroras
were not expected (Spaceweather.com).jw]

The sound.--The husband described the sound as a hum that cycled
from low to high to low.Â The wife described the sound as strange,
loud, and eerie, and she thought it was coming from deep in the woods.

The object.--Searching for the source of the sound, the husband
looked up and saw a hovering object.Â He described seeing a red
light make a circle at the top and cascade down to the base, thus
showing the size of the object (huge).Â Once the red light reached
the center of the base at the bottom, four lines of light went from the
center to the outside, completing a circle around the outside of the
object [as best I can understandjw].Â The amazing displaywas
repetitive.Â The husband followed the craft on foot as it moved
south, seeming to follow their driveway, made a right angle turn to the
west, now following a street. He said he got a side view of the object
and described its shape as like a top hat with a circular base.
He estimated the object was 200 feet in diameter, and estimated its
altitude as ~1,000 feet.

The wife described round lights of green, yellow, and a large red
light.Â She described the lights coming from the center of the
object and further described lines of light that went from the center
to the outer part, lighting up the underneath of the entire
object.Â She also described a repetitive light display.Â She
thought the shape was triangular,[whether a horizontal or vertical
triangle is not statedjw]. When she first saw the object it was
slightly to her left, right aboveher.Â She agreed the object moved
south along the drive and then made a right-angle turn to follow the
street.Â She also thought the objects altitude was ~1,000 feet,
and she thought the object moved with a zigzag pattern as her husband
was following it down the street.

No EM or physiological effects were reported.

[NOTE: Blimp seems at least a remote possibility when considering
this sighting.Â Â A search for blimp night advertising
displaysshows advertising blimp display broads up toÂ ~80-100 feet
long and 20-45 feet wide, one on each side of the blimp, with thousands
of lights.Â If the sound or the light display strikes anyone as
something they might have encountered associated with an advertising
blimp, it would be interesting to hear about it

Their near approach to the .surface and the subsequent flight away from the surface appeared to be most remarkable.

MAZARREDO,AR,2,13,1904,12:00:00,PM,1904-02-1312:00PM,"Un relato de las libretas del bisabuelo

Nuestro bisabuelo fue uno de los ingenieros que contruyeron el tel1grafo del Presidente Roca, as1 como las l1neas y las viviendas y puestos a lo largo de toda su traza.
Muchas de estas construcciones ya estaban listas para el a1o 1900 y por distintas razones se demoraron bastante en ponerlas en marcha em 1905.
Todav1a tenemos las libretas de campo del bisabuelo, quien por esos a1os ten1a unos 30 a1os y hab1a llegado a la Argentina contratado por el gobierno para esa obra y otras en otros lugares del pa1s.
Las casas en lo que 1l llama la ""Posta telegr1fica Mazarredo"", que en realidad era una estaci1n telegr1fica y no postal, y que mucha gente confund1a el nombre y le dec1a la ""casa de los carteros"".
1Vieron las pel1culas del viejo oeste de E.U. donde al lado de las v1as siempre hay alguien que env1a y recibe telegramas?, bueno en Mazarredo era igual ya que el tel1grafo del Pte. Roca iba a la par de las v1as del ferrocarril.
En las anotaciones del 13/2/1904 el bisabuelo escribe que estaba alojado en la posta Mazarredo y que al mediod1a estaban preparando el almuerzo cuando sintieron que los perros afuera empezaron a ladras y aullar muy alterados.
Entonces uuestro bisabuelo mir1 por las ventanas que daban en direcci1n al mar y vi1 muy cerca de la casa, el escribe como a unos 100 pies, dos peque1as figuras peque1as como duendes del alto de un postr de alambrado (algo as1 como 1 metro).
Escribe que estas figuras eran dif1ciles de ver porque se ve1an borrosas pero que brillaban con un color celeste muy brilante.
Dice que se parec1an a personas comunes pero de talla mas peque1a, casi como ni1os, y que estaban parados ah1 muy cerca de la casa y los perros.
Nuestro bisabuelo escribe que sali1 de la casa y fue al encuentro de estas dos figuras pero a medida que se fue acercando a ellas entre los gritos de los perros, 1stas se empezaron a alejar en direcci1n al mar.
Escribe que caminaban de una forma extra1a como si no supieran hacerlo y que cuando avanzaban parec1a como si se estuvieran deslizando sobre el hielo, aclara que no hab1a ni hielo ni nieve y que el sol estaba radiante.
Agrega que las figuras hacian un sonido smilar a un chasquido seco.
Cuenta adem1s que le cost1 tranquilizar a los perros junto con la otra gente que vivia en la casa.
Termina escribiendo nuestro bisabuelo que estas figuras le hicieron acordar a los relatos de seres fant1sticos que su abuelo le contaba cuando era ni1o de historias de los nativos americanos del oeste de los E.U. y que su padre dec1a que se parec1an mucho a las historias de duendes y hadas de las islas brit1nicas.
