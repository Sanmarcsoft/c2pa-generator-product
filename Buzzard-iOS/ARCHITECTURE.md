# Architecture Overview

Buzzard-iOS is designed with modularity and maintainability in mind. This document outlines the major components and design decisions taken throughout the development process.

## High-Level Architecture

- **Presentation Layer:**  
  Utilizes Storyboards/SwiftUI (or a mix of both) to build the user interface.
  
- **Business Logic Layer:**  
  Implements controllers, view models, and coordinators to manage state and logic. Common architectural patterns used include:
  - **MVC:** For simpler modules.
  - **MVVM:** For enhanced separation of UI and business logic.
  
- **Data Layer:**  
  Handles data persistence and networking:
  - **Networking:** Uses URLSession (or popular libraries such as Alamofire) for API integration.
  - **Persistence:** Core Data or Realm is used for local storage.
  
- **Third-Party Integrations:**  
  Any additional frameworks or packages (e.g., analytics, crash reporting) are integrated through Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods.

## Directory Structure

A typical directory for the project is organized as follows:

```
Buzzard-iOS/
├── AppDelegate.swift
├── SceneDelegate.swift
├── Controllers/
│   ├── HomeViewController.swift
│   ├── DetailViewController.swift
│   └── ...
├── Models/
│   ├── User.swift
│   ├── DataModel.swift
│   └── ...
├── Views/
│   ├── CustomComponents/
│   │   └── RoundedButton.swift
│   └── ...
├── ViewModels/
│   ├── HomeViewModel.swift
│   └── DetailViewModel.swift
├── Networking/
│   ├── APIManager.swift
│   ├── Endpoints.swift
│   └── ...
├── Resources/
│   ├── Assets.xcassets
│   ├── Localizable.strings
│   └── ...
└── Tests/
    ├── Buzzard_iOSTests.swift
    └── ...
```

## Design Patterns and Justifications

- **Modularization:**  
  Each major feature or module is encapsulated within its own directory, making the project easier to scale and maintain.

- **Dependency Injection:**  
  Used for injecting services and view models, promoting testability.

- **Reactive Programming (Optional):**  
  Depending on the module, frameworks like Combine may be used to handle asynchronous events.

## Future Enhancements

- Refactor legacy code to fully embrace MVVM for improved separation of concerns.
- Introduce additional unit tests and improve coverage for edge cases.
- Consider alternative state management solutions as the app scales.
