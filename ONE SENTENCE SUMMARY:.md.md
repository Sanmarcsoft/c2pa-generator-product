ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
A military witness describes observing a massive, silent triangular craft at Eglin Air Force Base that demonstrated physics-defying capabilities in 2006.

MAIN POINTS:
1. Daniel Dockarell witnessed a 300-foot triangular craft while recovering at Eglin Air Force Base medical facility.

2. The craft hovered silently with no oscillation, had white lights at each apex and center.

3. It demonstrated instant acceleration without sonic boom, defying known aviation physics.

4. Multiple military personnel and black SUVs were present during the craft's operation.

5. The witness was authorized to testify to Congress but couldn't attend for personal reasons.

6. The craft had no visible cockpit, fuselage, or conventional propulsion systems.

7. Initial powering up/down sounds shook the building before silent operation.

8. Other whistleblowers reported seeing identical craft with same characteristics.

9. Staff duty officer dismissed it as "Aurora project" testing.

10. Witness provided testimony to Congress and FBI about the incident.

TAKEAWAYS:
1. Advanced aerospace technology exists beyond publicly known capabilities.

2. Military installations are testing or operating highly exotic aircraft.

3. Multiple credible witnesses have observed similar triangular craft.

4. The technology demonstrates complete mastery over gravity and inertia.

5. Significant secrecy surrounds these advanced aviation programs.
